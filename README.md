Dear Reviewer

run_analysis.R file creates a tidy (I hope so) dataset "tidydataset.txt", using the files given in Coursera assignment. 

The work of the script is briefly explained by #comments in the script itself, but the main steps are:

1) Reading the necessary files. 

2) Creating 2 data sets for train and test measures, and merging them together.

3) Making the data set more readable by changing variable names and Activity labels.

4) Creating a new data set which shows the means for all variables by Subject-Variable pairs.


Thanks for your attention.
